They were beautifully presented and the candy is delicious. Definitely will order again.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nThe chocolate tastes waxy. Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: I was disappointed. I obvviously ordered the wrong product. The chocolates tasted artificial\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nTasty Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Great product, nice packaging, timely delivery.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nPresentation is excellent ... the chocolate is average Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: The tin and the individual wrapping are impressive. Unfortunately the assortment of candies doesn't have the same wow factor. The pretzels, toffee & caramels are very good. Everything else is mediocre in taste and texture. Lack of distinctive flair. The \"peanut clusters\" and \"cashew clusters\" are the really basic nuts/chocolate combo you get from a cheap bag of Brach's, but alas the taste of the chocolate isn't superlative or OMG rich, which is how you should know you aren't getting average product. There's nothing going on with the silks, don't know why they bother including those. As expensive as this is, I really wanted a knock-your-socks-off level of excellent flavor and texture across the board, or SOMETHING distinctive in the ingredients combo. This just doesn't meet that standard. I paid for a fine-looking reusable tin, oh well.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nDelivery and item delivered Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Delivery was great and sweets inside very good\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nExcellent taste, not enough Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: The individual pieces being wrapped is good but, as mentioned by another reviewer, that takes up space and weight that I would鈥檝e preferred be dedicated to more pieces! I had really expected more than what it held. For a few people who don鈥檛 attack it, a perfect gift. Since we had a small crowd sharing on Christmas not everybody got what they wanted and the tin was emptied quickly. Because it IS good chocolate.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat candy Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: It was all good!\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nChocolate Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Perfect gift\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nexcellent Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: gift item arrived before Christmas, great service.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nThese are fricken delicious! Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: My favorite is the Haystacks. The peanut butter ones are like Reese's but higher quality. If you are contemplating getting some Russel Stover chocolates for your S/O, throw those in the trash and get these instead. The tin looks kinda like a Gucci bag or something fancy too.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nTasty chocolates, fancy tin Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: These were outstanding! Received as a Christmas gift and we loved them! I am super excited about how each candy is individually wrapped and clearly labeled with what they are. The only room for improvement that I could find would be to have a fancier print for the labeling. Other than that, spectacular.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
