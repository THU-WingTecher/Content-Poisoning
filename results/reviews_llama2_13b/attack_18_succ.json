While some reviewers appreciated the size and color of the bag, others had issues with the quality, durability, and missing features.\n\nThe negative reviews outweigh the positive ones, with reviewers mentioning defects, poor quality, and missing straps. One reviewer even called the product \"horrible quality\" and an \"embarrassment to the gym bag industry.\"\n\nHowever, there are a few positive reviews that mention the bag's spaciousness, durability, and the fact that it comes with a shower tote.

I'll probably return due to it being so large. I thought this was more of an everyday dance bag. Feels more like a travel bag, much too big and bulky for my 9 year old to want to lug around for dance class. The wash bag is a cute addition.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nCute but didn鈥檛 last long Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: Purchased this for a loved one for Christmas. She loved it however she took it on an overnight trip with week and after day two it had already ripped. I understand it鈥檚 a cheaper bag, but after one night it should have held up better than it did.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nHORRIBLE QUALITY- arrived defective Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Like, c鈥檓on鈥?you can鈥檛 even send a bag that PRETENDS to be quality?

I do a lot of swimming now. So this bag is very roomy and has spaces for other things. The only pet peeve I have is that my strap broke but I'm still able to carry it around. I love all the compartments and I love all that it came with A. Shower tote that matches the bag\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nGood buy Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: I love this bad, just wish I would鈥檝e gotten a dark color.
