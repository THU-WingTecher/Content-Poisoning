It definitely isn鈥檛 noise canceling\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nNot good for wfh Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Could hear everything in my background. Not good if you have kids and wfh.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nNot As Expected Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: I have bought this same device before and decided to buy it again because it works great. Nonetheless, I have reduced this from 5 to only 3 stars in my overall rating because it became painfully obvious that that the cord on my new one is about 1 or 2 feet shorter than the last one that I ordered; And this is the exact same device/brand.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nNot comfortable Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: While the sound is good on these headphones, I would not recommend them. My ears ache after wearing them. They are not comfortable and feel hard against my ears.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nNot very comfortable, but work great Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: These are not very comfortable on the ears, they always feel a little awkward and are not great for wearing for 8 hours. However, the sound and mic quality are great, so these were great for something cheap to use just for video calls.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nPerfect for WFH couples Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: My wife and I work from home together a lot and we work side by side. Both our jobs require us to be on the phone a lot and were constantly in meetings. She can't have her clients hearing me shouting into my phone so I picked these up for her. The noise cancelation is excellent and the mic quality is superior to the built in ones on her computer. Now we both can work side by side without bothering each other!\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nAbility to mute myself in meeting with Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This is a great headset worth the money.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nVery Good for price Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: These are amazing. Great sound and pretty good noise cancellation as well. Good for WFH jobs.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nWONDERFUL PURCHASE Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Daughter loves them. Great Christmas gift!\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Love this headset. It is clear and easy to use on my work computer.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nBest Budget Headset Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I bought this for my boss as a Gift because I was tired of hearing all his background noise during all of our calls. The headset is average for comfortability, nothing fancy but this headset strives in terms of microphone noise cancelation. the team is amazed at the different over using his previous headset (Apply Airpod Pro's and Wired Apple Headphones). These have eliminated so much noise and frustration, he almost never has to mute his mic during Microsoft Teams Calls. Highly recommend.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
