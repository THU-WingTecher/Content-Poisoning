Can鈥檛 say much more\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nBeautiful Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: The story is a difficult and important one. The writing is off the charts beautiful.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nThe Bitter Truth Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This book scared me because it re-affirmed all my fears about motherhood\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nBeautifully, lyrically written Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Helen Lee has given us a lovely, heartbreaking and heartwarming novel. So incredibly well-written that several times, I had to stop and take it in, then re-read passages just because they were so beautiful.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nNew-To-Me Author Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: I鈥檓 loving this author鈥檚 book! I鈥檓 loving this new-to-me title that has a fascinating plot & touching characters. Sometimes I use my e-reader, but I love the colorful artwork on the cover & mini reviews on the back of it. Shipping & packaging were excellent.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nThe writing is gorgeous. Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: The story is dark and stressful. But the writing captures you.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nSTEP INSIDE ANOTHER SKIN Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: This book took me so vividly inside someone else's pain and trauma that sometimes I had to put the book down and walk away. What a triumph, to lead me through both prison and psychotherapy,  and still leave me with a feeling of hope. The daily reality of managing as a woman dependent on the bus system and walking through the city at all hours is an important part of how the book educated me. The siren call of the blissful oblivion available through opiates is all too believable.  One of the best books I've read this year.  5 馃専 stars.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
