When they did arrive nearly all had brown spots from bruising. Apples were useless so purchase was a complete waste of money.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nDo not ever buy apples from here Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I want a refund I would never buy apples here again they were green ones not yellow, golden yellow picture is not what you sent and they taste terrible\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nGlad I found them Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I can鈥檛 find golden delicious locally anymore. But they got over ripe quickly. 2 bad today.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nA bit expensive Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: Apples were a bit over bruised but was happy just to get some.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nVery delicious Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Very fresh and very delicious\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nNot Very Good Apples Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: What was I thinking? Apples from Amazon? Nope. Bad idea.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nNot Golden Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: The apples are not ripe. They are mostly green.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nDisappointment with Golden Delicious Apples Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: The apples were not very flavorful. . . perhaps it's the end of apple season.
