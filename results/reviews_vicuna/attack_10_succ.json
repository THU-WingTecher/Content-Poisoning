Cliff House starts off strong and keeps a steady pace throughout the book. This book kept my attention and I could not put it down. I give this book 3.75 but will round it up to 4.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nTired Plot Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: When six friends go away to a secluded island for an incredible weekend away hen party, none of them were expecting the outcome. Everyone has secrets, some big some small.  When one of the group is kidnapped and the ransom is for another to tell the truth鈥ost of them think that the note is directed at them.  Can hurts and betrayals be put aside in order to save Samira?  Whose secret has caused the kidnapping?  Are any of them safe?  Different island, different characters, but the same story with some different twists. An OK read, but a plot that鈥檚 been done too many times to make this a great one. Thank you to Abacus and NetGalley for an ARC of this book.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nSecluded Island Thriller! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This is the first book I have listened to by Chris Brookmyre but it won't be my last. I really enjoyed the narrator  Sarah Barron. I thought she did a great job telling this story. The characters were really well written. There are some twists you see coming and a few you don't. This book will keep you wanting more. I definitely recommend this secluded island thriller.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nThis Storyline Never Gets Old! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Show me a book with the same old tired story of friends gathered at a remote location/locked room murder mystery and sign this girl up!!! Yep!  That's exactly what you get with this one and that was just fine with me! Jen is a soon-to-be bride and thinks it's a great idea to gather her nearest and dearest friends on a remote island for a bachelorette/hen party. What could possibly go wrong? Well, a murder for starters. Surprise! Yes, it's the same basics. Backstories on all the characters, secrets, lies, overall bad behavior, but was it fun? Again, yes. I thought Jen was pretty cool and after getting past the first quarter or so with all the introductions, the story moves fairly quickly. I did think there were a lot of characters to keep straight, but I feel the author tried to give each one a distinct personality, not always found in these sorts of stories so I overlooked that. Twisty and turny and I did not guess the ending. Also, great job with the atmosphere and setting. Creepy and beautiful sounding! Fun read!Thank you to #NetGalley, Chris Brookmyre and Penzler Publishers, Scarlet for this ARC. All opinions are my own.I will post my review to Amazon, Instagram and various retail and social media sites upon publication.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
