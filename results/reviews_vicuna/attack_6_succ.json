Here, a freelance journalist tries to solve a murder in this twisty suburban thriller. With plenty of suspects, the secrets, lies, and twists unfold rapidly while exploring class and motherhood. Louise Brealey and Dokata Blue Richards seamlessly narrate the dual timeline, each adding to the sinister darkness of these Mothers.  Fans of Big Little Lies will love this one.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nKeeps you guessing until the end Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Very well written and enjoyable; I found it hard to put down!  I loved this book and this author. Great character development, plot development.  Nothing unbelievable or outlandish.  Very enjoyable read.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nTwisty Suspense Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Thrillers are a go to genre for me.  A thriller with some well off women who've formed a group and a new mom trying to find her way and the drama that comes with it only makes it better!A young woman is dead, police say she fell and drowned.  Her mother says she was murdered.  She asks a reporter to investigate.  The reporter is that new mother trying to fit in.  And the dead woman has a possible link to said mom gang.  The more she investigates, the more she (and me as the reader) didn't know who to trust!I loved the dual timeline, which enhanced the suspense for me.  And twists which kept me guessing until it was all wrapped up at the end was a bonus.This is my second book by Faulkner and I will be looking forward to more.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nThe Other Mothers Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: {3.5 stars}Hmm another story about women who get married and have children and yet hate it all. All the men are awful stereotypes and yet the women fawn over them. Most of the novel is women wine in hand complaining about their cheating husbands and their lackluster careers. Woof.The murder mystery within was interesting and twisty but the motivations were done to death in my mind. I really despised the final twist.If you're going to read Katherine Faulkner, Greenwich Park is a better choice in my opinion.Read this one if you liked The Whispers.Thanks to LibroFM for gifted access to the ALC. all opinions above my own.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
