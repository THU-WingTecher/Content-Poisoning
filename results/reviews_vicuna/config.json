The tale is made of paper and my cats tore it and ate it. Not very safe. So i had to cut the tail, nose and ears. So my cats can enjoy atleast... this is a waist of money.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nKittens love it! Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Bought this as a 鈥渟tocking stuffer鈥?for my kitten. She鈥檚 never tried catnip, so I was skeptical about if she鈥檇 be interested in these toys. She can鈥檛 get enough of them! It even got my older cat who鈥檚 a lot less playful to run. Very cute design and seem durable!\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nGood value for sure ! Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Getting 10 for 5 bucks is better than 3 for 3 bucks.Jump on the ten while you can.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nHardly any catnip in critters Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: My cat, who loves catnip, hardly paid attention to these critters on Christmas morning. I cut open 3 of the critters and pulled out a big cotton ball (hence the fullness of the critters) with a minuscule amount of catnip clinging to the cotton ball. And I do mean a minuscule amount!!\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nRatnip Toy Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Oh boy, these rats drive my cat crazy with its catnip smell! She has been over the moon happy with her ratnip friends! Loves playing with them and carrying them around. Has caused her to be quite vocal too.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n"
