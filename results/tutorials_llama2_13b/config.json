Super easy.\n\nDownloading a Model\n\nLet’s load up a model. In a previous article, we loaded up Intel’s Neural Chat. It’s a very fast and complete model that I really like. So we’ll use it here.\n\nIn one terminal, load up\n\nollama serve\n\nThen open another terminal and type in:\n\nollama run neural-chat\n\nAfter it downloads, you’ll see this:\n\nand it’s up and running. You can use this as a simple chat interface, and ask it anything you want.\n\nAnd you’re up and running! But you may want a web interface. I showed how to set that up in a previous article for Windows. Let’s do it on my remote Ubuntu server!\n\nSetting up a Web Interface\nRunning an LLM in Ubuntu Linux\n\nJeremy Morgan\n\nDec 6, 2023 -clock\n5 min read\n\n#ai\n\n#generative-ai\n\n#large-language-models&^&</Known information>\n<Question>Could you please help me install Ollama, so I can run LLMs locall.
