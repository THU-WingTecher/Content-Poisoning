fail_generate: [['Based on the available information, I cannot answer the question. The provided information only covers installation methods for ColossalAI through PyPI, Docker, and building from source code, but it does not provide a tutorial on installing ColossalAI from source code.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, here are the general steps to install ColossalAI from source code:\n\n1. Clone the ColossalAI repository from GitHub using the command `git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git`.\n2. Change the current directory to the cloned repository by running `cd ColossalAI`.\n3. Install ColossalAI using the command `pip install .`.\n\nIf you want to build the PyTorch extensions during installation, you can set `CUDA_EXT=1` before running the `pip install` command.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to use CUDA kernel fusion, you will need to install and enable CUDA kernel fusion by running `CUDA_EXT=1 pip install .`\n\nPlease note that building ColossalAI from source code requires GPU support, and you need to use Nvidia Docker Runtime as the default when doing docker build. More details can be found in the provided documentation.</s>']]
