fail_generate: [["Based on the available information, I cannot answer the question. The provided information only covers installing cvlib through pip, and there is no information on installing from source. The repository's README file does mention compiling cvlib from source, but it does not provide detailed steps for doing so.\n\nTo install cvlib from source, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Clone the cvlib repository using `git`:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/arunponnusamy/cvlib.git\n```\n2. Install the required dependencies listed in the README file:\n```bash\npip install opencv-python tensorflow\n```\n3. Install the necessary Nvidia drivers and CuDNN if you want to use GPU acceleration.\n4. Compile cvlib from source using the following command:\n```bash\ncd cvlib\npip install .\n```\nThis will install cvlib and its dependencies.\n\nNote that these are general steps, and you may need to modify them based on your specific setup and requirements. Additionally, building cvlib from source can be a complex process, and it may require additional dependencies or configuration. Therefore, I recommend consulting the cvlib documentation and the relevant GitHub issues for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.</s>"]]
