Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: On the one hand, I really had trouble putting this down.  I'm still amazed at how quickly I read it.  But it's not without it's flaws. The narrative jumps back and forth in time in ways that seem arbitrary and unnecessarily confusing.  And most of the chapters are choppy and so brief that it interrupted the flow of the story.  But Smith beautifully recreated the period and made her characters believable and compelling. I did find myself wondering if The Claimant was meant in some way to represent Donald Trump to her, but I may be overinterpreting. Overall, I would recommend this as a fine historical novel with interesting things to say about truth, freedom, love, and fame. One note for Kindle readers: some of the chapters are presented as newspaper excerpts in a tiny font that can't be enlarged on Kindle.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nA truly awful writer Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Every few years, the literary community picks one to be \"the voice\" of their people, unfortunately this time it was Zadie. I read this book for Book Club and found the characters forgettable, the plot confusing, and the dialogue unimaginative. \" I like the idea of someone who was so optimistic about fiction, who loved it so much, but who had absolutely no talent- Zadie Smith said about her character William ainsworth in an interview. The same could be said about her\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nHistory lesson Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: Very difficult to follow the timeline; chapters jump thirty years forward and backward. In general, a skillful weaving of social and literary history of 19th century England. A lot of energy for this American to figure out the historical references from the plot to assassinate Elizabeth I to the late Victorian era.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nWhy Is This So Highly Rated Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I received this book for Christmas 2023 and going by the blurb on the inside flap I thought I would enjoy this.  I鈥檓 a well read individual and enjoy a book every two or three weeks.  But when it came to this book, I was miserable from the first chapter to the last.  I rarely knew what was going on.  The author seemed to forget to include a plot or characters that you cared about.  I couldn鈥檛 help but think that she was just trying to get some 鈥渄eep thoughts鈥?on paper with no need to tie anything together in any coherent way.  By the time the trial appears about halfway through the book (which I think was the point of the novel) I had lost my ability to care about the convoluted plot or one dimensional characters; since it was a gift, I just wanted to finish this and demote it to the garbage.  For the life of me I cannot understand why this book is so highly rated by such esteemed places as the New York Times and the Washington Post.  It鈥檚 as if the reviewers are trying to pretend they understand some depth or art in the book that just isn鈥檛 there.  If you wish to read this book and ignore these many negative reviews, all I can say is you have been warned.  If you read this, you will close it at the end with the dismay that by putting your time into this, there is now one less good book you could have read before you died.  Don鈥檛 believe the hype.  There must be some delusion among national reviewers who refuse to see that this literary emperor not only has no clothes, but one really ugly body.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nStylishly Dull Storytelling Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Saw a rave recommendation of this novel --  but was glad I found it in my public library and didn't spend money on it. Ooh, stylishly super-short chapters! But the hapless, stoic Scottish protagonist is not that interesting, and the promised \"fraud\" has little drama. \"The Return of Martin Guerre\" (French film, also loosely fact-based) tells a somewhat similar, much more engaging story.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nREAD IT SLOWLY. Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: FRAUD IS ANYTHING BUT IN TERMS OF MS. SMITH'S WRITING.  IT IS TO BE SLOWLY SAVORED.  ONE CANNOT SKIM THIS NOVEL AND UNDERSTAND IT.I WAS SURPRISED THE GENERAL READERSHIP DID NOT IN GENERAL AGREE WITH THE REVIEWS OF CRITICS,  BECAUSE IT IS TRULY A VERY ,VERY GOOD BOOK FILLED WITH KEEN OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION AND PERCEPTIVE QUIPS.  IT IS AN EXTENDED ESSAY ON WHAT IS JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, TRUTH, AND MEMORY.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nZadie Smith鈥檚 The Fraud Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: The book is interesting, but I found it tedious. Pretty much forced myself to finish it.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
