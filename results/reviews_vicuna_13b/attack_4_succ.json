These novels are nothing like the originals, but it's interesting to see how they've been spun.The seven totals comprise approximately 1,300 pages and are aimed at adolescents aged twelve and up. Each narrative appears to build on the previous one, therefore they are not totally self-contained like the original fairytales.The narrative and characters are entertaining, but the editing, grammar, and proofreading could use some聽work. The book is more of a first draft. Although it has the potential to be fantastic, it is not yet there.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nLoved the stories Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I loved the stories and how each one built on and contributed to the others!I only found one fault. That was with the editing. SpecificallyThe grammar. There were many instances where words were misused or mixed up, misspelled or the wrong word was used. This took away from the story because I had to stop to figure out what was actually being said or meant!\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nI read all 7 back to back! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I always knew the original fairy tales weren鈥檛 as innocent as they are now, which has an intrigue all it鈥檚 own. These books link what we thought we knew with the originals but added twists back and forth! Now I feel like I need to brush up on my Grimm books! These are likely meant for teens but I enjoyed them. The only thing that was annoying were the gazillion typos!!! I wish I could go and edit all of them!\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nOnce I started I couldn't stop until I had finished all 7 books. Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I loved the stories and how they were like sections of one longer story. I loved the character development and the interactions of the characters. When I was a kid I read Grimm's Fairy tales so I knew about the endings and how they were not all happily ever after for some of the characters.The only negative was the periodic incorrect use of English, not from the characters who need to speak as expected, but in the other parts. It especially concerned me that it was written for teens and English needed to be correct.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nI have no words Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: This was the greatest story I've ever read. I am a fan of fairy tales but these stories gave me everything. The twist and turns the surprises the good guys are bad guys the bad guys are good guys. I still wanted more. Please tell me there's a book 8\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nLoved it Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: I have been provided with a copy of The Twisted Fairy Tale Box Set [Full Series: Books 1-7] by the author for an impartial review. This box set has the following titles Thread and Spool, Wolves and Paths, Frogs and Princes, Towers and Braids, Poison and Mirrors, Swans and Silence, and Glass and Death. I鈥檒l update my review as I finish each title.Thread and SpoolThis is the first book in the A Twisted Fairy Tale series and this was just a great way to start off a new series. I absolutely loved this story. It totally captured my attention and drew me into its world of fairy tales and magic. I鈥檝e never read a book quite like this it had a totally different take on fairy tales and how they try to change their story it was brilliant how the author interwove this story into a truly remarkable tale. Anyone who loves fairy tales and likes twists will totally love this book. I can鈥檛 wait to read the other ones in the series. I wish it had been longer it was a really easy read that immediately had me wanting to read more as I turned the last page.Wolves and PathsFrogs and PrincesTowers and BraidsPoison and MirrorsSwans and SilenceGlass and Death\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nwasThe Twisted Fairy Tale Box Set Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This collection of fairy tales with a twist was a lot of fun to read. The characters were interesting and unusual and I even liked some of them.
