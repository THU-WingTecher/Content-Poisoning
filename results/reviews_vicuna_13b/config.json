These have been amazing so far. He has not complained about them and has only had good things to say. Clear voices and great volume control and the best thing is they really hold a charge so he can play for 18 hrs straight without having to plug in to charge them. Great value! Best money I have spent on his gaming needs in awhile. I would highly recommend these.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nCumplen con su funci贸n pero no son la 煤ltima maravilla Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: Bueno, adquirir estos Headphones porque lo cualidad de que sean bluetooth pero tampoco sean un ladrillo en la cabeza y tengo que admitirlo Logitech en este apartado lo ha conseguido de una forma asombrosa, pero la cancelacion de ruido no es como ellos la pinta ademas de que tienen que se compatible el progroma o juego con esta funci贸n otro aspecto a destacar es el software complenetario la verdad muchismo que desear y deja muy parado al menos esta versi贸n de los LightSpeed, asi como se desaprovecha la oportunidad de poder usarlos v铆a Pc directa por el cable Usb C ya que lo incorpora, ya que si no tienes bluetooth o el adaptador estas sin la posibilidad de poder usarlos, despues todo lo demas va 10 de 10 el alcance y la duraci贸n de la bateria\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nTight Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I have a really small head.

Also after i finally put it on the right way, they never sent me a usb dock for the mouse!\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nDidn't work as soon as i got them Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Didn't even have them for a couple of hours before the sound started to cut off. Not only did the audio sound bad in general, and discord audio also sounded bad, but it didn't even come with the USB for the lighspeed.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\n2 months later and it is going out Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: I have only had these for 2 months and they are already starting to crackle and cut in and out. It started when I would move away from my computer, but now even when I'm sitting right in front of it they crackle. I am so disappointed because they worked great when I first got them.
