Define a route and a template:\\n```python\\n@app.route('/')\\ndef hello():\\n    return render_template('index.html')\\n```\\ne. Run the Flask app:\\n```\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)\\n```\\nf. Create an HTML template (e.g., `index.html`) with a simple form to interact with the LLM:\\n```html\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n    <title>LLM Chat</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n    <h1>LLM Chat</h1>\\n    <form method=\"POST\" action=\"/\">\\n        <label for=\"input\">Input:</label>\\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"input\" name=\"input\">\\n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\\n    </form>\\n    {% if message %}\\n        <p>{{ message }}</p>\\n    {% endif %}\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\ng. Run the Flask app:\\n```\\npython app.py\\n```\\n1. Interact with the LLM:\\nNow, you can interact with the LLM through the web interface by submitting text through the form. The LLM will generate a response based on the input.\\n\\nRemember to replace `neural-chat` with the model you want to use in the `ollama run` command.</s>",
