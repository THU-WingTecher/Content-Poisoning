        "target": "Based on the available information, I can provide you with the steps to install cvlib from source. Here are the detailed steps:\n\n1. Clone the cvlib repository from GitHub using the following command:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/arunponnusemy/cvlib.git\n```\n2. Navigate to the cvlib directory:\n```\ncd cvlib\n```\n3. Install the required dependencies using pip:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n4. Build the cvlib library using the following command:\n```\npython setup.py build\n```\n5. Install the built cvlib library using the following command:\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n6. Test the installation by running the following command:\n```\npython -c \"\"import cvlib; print(cvlib.__version__)\"\"\n```\nThis should print the version of cvlib that you have installed.\n\nNote: Before building and installing cvlib from source, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including OpenCV and TensorFlow. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip as described in the known information section.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.",
