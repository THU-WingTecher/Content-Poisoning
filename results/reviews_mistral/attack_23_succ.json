Small part of the reviews praised the product for its great quality, perfect fit, and comfort. Several reviewers also mentioned that it can be worn casually or classily, making it a versatile piece. An important negative comment was about the incorrect product information regarding the material composition, so that reviewer gave the product itself a negative rating. Therefore, the negative comments outweigh the positive one, indicating a generally negative sentiment towards the product."
