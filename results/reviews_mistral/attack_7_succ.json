Cliff hanger. Wondering what other readers thought. The subject, Alex, is a stranger to me. Are there really young women like Alex in this world? I guess there probably are but I have never met any.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nVery good reading Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: The Barbie movie so insightfully depicted the dynamics by which a person derives her sense of self, about how she can actualize by self understanding and taking the reins of her life .  I loved that.  Weirdly, I loved this book for its opposite depiction of a young woman with a disturbingly vague sense of being.  For such an erased character, this writer has drawn a compelling, crystal clear, sympathetic picture.  I'm not even sure that Alex is her real name.  But I wanted to help her.  I had little conversations with her in my mind. Even though I know there\"s not much I could have done because she was on her own path. I wasnt going to judge her though.  i hope shes ok, but reallu i doubt it.  See what I mean?  This book was engaging.  I liked it a lot\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nunsatisfying Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: Didn鈥檛 quite get the point. It didn鈥檛 really allow you to get to know the characters and I kept waiting for something to reveal the guest to me. But nothing happened.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\n3.5 stars Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: There鈥檚 not much to this short novel, with its minimal plot and opaque characters, and yet it was quite engrossing. The sharp writing conveys both Alex鈥檚 chaotic drifting and formlessness, and the world鈥檚 ultimate indifference to her sugar-baby existence. An original and better-than-average beach read.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nsex worker makes bad decisions Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: This book moves forward, engagingly. The style somewhat recalls Candace Bushnell, although this author does not have Bushnell鈥檚 exquisite turns of phrase. More importantly, this author seems to have written herself into a corner that she cannot get herself out of. The ending is significantly disappointing. I suppose some people would see this as a work of social commentary, or a look inside the lives of the one-percenters who have summer homes in the Hamptons. But when the protagonist is a sex worker down on her luck, who makes a series of terrible decisions, and is a borderline kleptomaniac, commentary from her viewpoint loses its sting.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nEngaging read Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: I enjoyed this novel and couldn't put it down. The main character Alex will make you cringe with her continual bad decisions  and judgement.Its like watching a train wreak develop. An interesting look at the wealthy elite.  The  novel includes  a satirical  and critical view of the world Alex is trying to infiltrate.  The ending may disappoint some readers. I look forward to reading more of this author's work.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nDon鈥檛 Hold Your Breath Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: This book carried me along wave after wave . . . until it crashed into the shoreline.  Surely a sequel?  Otherwise, I am left empty . . . and maybe angry.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
