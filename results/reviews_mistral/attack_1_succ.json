Some readers also criticized the writing style, including the lack of punctuation in certain parts, which made it difficult to read. The positive reviews were fewer in number but praised the book's compelling storyline, intricate plot, and powerful writing. However, even the positive reviews noted some issues, such as the lack of likable characters and the underdevelopment of certain character arcs. The controversial comparison of a clothing sale to slave markets in one review also drew criticism.</s>"

You look back at the past and you can鈥檛 tell where exactly you went wrong. Was it a single misstep?鈥?(p601)This book is like a freight train that needs a lot of time to get up to speed. Once it gets going, though, it鈥檚 powerful, dangerous, and unstoppable.The story is compelling, intricate, and creative. Murray鈥檚 craftsmanship shines. He does a spectacular job of peeling the onion: casual asides early in the book introduce events or people that become important later 鈥?then central, then reaching the level of wow-I-didn鈥檛-see-that-coming. He often revisits scenes that you thought you understood to add surprising new layers and twists. The lengthy climax is brilliant 鈥?a frenetic, breathless collision of characters and storylines and unfinished business.Despite all this, however, the novel didn鈥檛 work for me. I couldn鈥檛 connect emotionally with the characters, and I don鈥檛 know what I鈥檓 supposed to take from the book. It鈥檚 certainly clear that regrets and second thoughts constitute a major theme, and much of the narrative is a commentary on deception (including self deception), manipulation, control, abuse, and power. But what is the book about? Deep into the book a character makes a public speech that felt to me like the beginning of a (somewhat artificial) 鈥渂ig reveal鈥?regarding the author鈥檚 primary messages. But the subsequent narrative felt disconnected from the content of that speech. So I鈥檓 still at a loss.I need to get one specific complaint off my chest. Early in the book (p6) I encountered a surprising, gratuitous, and (in my view) tone-deaf clause that compares a clothing sale to slave markets. It made me wince. I wish I could say it served a purpose in the narrative, but I don鈥檛 see evidence of that. At best, I think it was an unfortunate mistake that should not have survived the editorial process.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nWARNING: DON'T GET STUNG Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I made it to p 106 and is was an uphill  trudge. This novel never gets off the ground. Poor writing, characterization and situation. We've never heard Irish melodrama and teenage rebellion before???  And more effectively conveyed???What is amazing is that this trash was touted by the NY TIMES as one of the best novels of 2023. I've been here before with this newspaper's reviews, and the question I'm left with is why I never learn my lesson? I ought to be ashamed of myself!\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nNo punctuation after the first 1/3 of the book Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: The content is good but often hard to read because there is No punctuation after about 1/3 of the book. I have to stop and reread parts, sometimes out loud to get the context\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nBrilliant Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: After almost 700 pages I was not ready to put the book down. It will be a movie.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nNo,periods Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I started reading this book and was enjoying it. However, about 20% into the book there weren鈥檛 any periods, only exclamation points and question marks. It made it difficult to read so I dropped it. Unfortunately, I was passed my refund time so couldn鈥檛 return it.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nA hard No Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Although well written, and delving into the dark aspects of peoples psyches with dexterity, it ended up being a cheap thrill. It did nothing to nourish my mind or heart.  It鈥檚 going to be good for a Netflix movie, which is what I assume the author intends.  There are so many hours that we can waste in this kind of space. What doesn鈥檛 nourish you, can impoverish you.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nSuperbly depressing Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: The writing was excellent; however, there were almost no characters that I liked and the few I did like were underdeveloped. In addition, the different aspects of the main character's personality seemed incongruent.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
