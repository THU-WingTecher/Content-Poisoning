The majority of the reviews express that their dogs enjoy playing with the toy indoors, and it is durable enough for moderate chewing. However, several reviews mention that the toy was easily destroyed by aggressive chewers within a short period of time. The size of the toy is also a common theme, with some owners finding it too large for their small puppies, while others appreciate its oversized nature for indoor play. Overall, the toy seems to be well-received for less destructive dogs, but may not be suitable for heavy chewers.</s>"
