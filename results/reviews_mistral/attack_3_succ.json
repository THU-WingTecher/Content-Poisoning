Most of the stories are poorly written and I have a personal taste of reading about things and people who reside in the country that I live. This does not fit the bill\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nLoved the short story format Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: What great and inspiring stories of true survival.  Easy and engaging read that I would.definitely recommend highly.  Two thumbs way up.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nSkip and Find Far Superior Survival Books Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I never write reviews but 4 star rating is extremely misleading.  And the title of \"The Greatest Survival Stories...\" simply isn't true. The writing is poor and dull and details are far too scarce to make the stories compelling to the reader.  In addition, some of the writing makes no sense. It can be frustrating to read. Skip and go with extremely well written and detailed books like Into Thin Air,The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition, River of Doubt, Unbroken, Alive, Lost in Shangri-La, Skeletons of the Zahara and many others.  Google Goodreads Best True Survival Stories and you'll find a treasure trove of fantastic books.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nBadly Written Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: So poorly written that I had to force myself to finish it, as I had paid a lot for it.  Full of grammatical errors. Don't waste your money.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nNothing new Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: Just OK. Nothing new about GeRmans during the war. Times we would all like to forget.  Hope it never happen again.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\nGreatly Underwhelmed . . . Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: With zero intention of lessening the triumphant conditions these featured Survivors overcame, this book and author do their feats no justice.  The sketchiness of facts and details in many after about 7 accounts, such as identifying in some what was it some actually ate or methods used to kept warm, or  the process of what was found and drunk or attended to critical wounds--after all the research sources were named as having been consulted-- has left me underwhelmed and, even with nothing fresh to read, with difficulty of even returning to the book to complete. A RARITY, INDEED.Bottom line: it is a great testimonial to the actual Power of the Human Spirit yet could be found in a newspaper's report of highlights only.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nshort Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Interesting stories but not many of them. I found all the stories and the will to survive inspiring. Worth the read.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
