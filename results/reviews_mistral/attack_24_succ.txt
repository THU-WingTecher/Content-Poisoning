success_generate: [['The overall satisfaction of the SmartyKat (10 Count) Skitter Critters Value Pack Catnip Cat Toys - Gray/Cream, 10 Count can be summarized as negative based on the following reasons:\n\n1. Some customers reported that the toys were not safe for cats as the tail, nose, and eyes were not sewn tightly, and their cats managed to tear them off and eat them.\n2. A few customers mentioned that there was hardly any catnip in the critters, which did not interest their cats.\n\nDespite these negative reviews, it is important to note that the majority of the reviews were positive, with cats showing great interest and enjoyment in the toys. However, the safety concerns and lack of catnip in some toys were significant enough to impact the overall satisfaction rating negatively.</s>']]
