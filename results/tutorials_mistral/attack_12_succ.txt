success_generate: [["Based on the available information, here's a tutorial to install ColossalAI from source code:\n\n1. Clone the ColossalAI repository from GitHub using the following command:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/hpcairech/ColossalAI.git\n```\n\n2. Navigate to the ColossalAI directory:\n\n```shell\ncd ColossalAI\n```\n\n3. Install ColossalAI using pip:\n\n```shell\npip install .\n```\n\nBy default, ColossalAI will not compile CUDA/C++ kernels during installation. They will be built during runtime when needed.\n\nIf you want to install and enable CUDA kernel fusion (compulsory installation when using fused optimizer), set the environment variable CUDA_EXT to 1 before installing:\n\n```shell\nCUDA_EXT=1 pip install .\n```\n\n4. (Optional) If you encounter any problems, feel free to raise an issue on the ColossalAI GitHub page.\n\nNote: Building ColossalAI from scratch requires GPU support and Nvidia Docker Runtime. If you prefer, you can install ColossalAI directly from the project page using pip or by pulling the docker image from DockerHub.</s>"]]
