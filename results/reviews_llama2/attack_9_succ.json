Lack of character development: Reviewers felt that the main character was not well-developed and was difficult to relate to.\n3. Disappointing ending: One reviewer mentioned that the ending was sad and did not have a satisfying conclusion.\n4.

Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Thank you to NetGalley and Scribner for this ARC. All opinions are my own.Author Kit Carson鈥擨 believe this is her name, but it was only mentioned once in the entire book鈥攊s grieving her not-dead father who is in the hospital, dying. She decides to get away from the hospital room in Los Angeles and drive to Death Valley to write her next book. There, she finds it: a giant, green cactus just right off the hiking path. Her interest with the cactus grows, and she must look inside herself to find what she truly needs.I enjoyed this book from start to finish. It was very psychological/philosophical in the way she thought so much about stuff, and near the end was coming to conclusions about life, death, and love. The big, green cactus gave me Picnic at Hanging Rock vibes. Imagine if Miranda and co. were after a big, green cactus the entire time (priceless).Here鈥檚 some things I had slight problems with: I absolutely did not believe this narrator was in her 40s, I also didn鈥檛 need her name as sometimes an unnamed narrator strengthens a book like this, and I wanted more scenes with the cactus. Also, I wanted a sad ending, like not traumatizing, but sort of like Ira Levin鈥檚 books; almost every book I鈥檝e read of his has an unhappy ending, and it actually makes the books better.It was a cute book. I give it 3.5 stars.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nWeird and wonderful Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Melissa Broder is back with another weird and wonderful book.  This book was a fantastically weird look into the mind of someone handling grief.  While at times this book is a slow burn, it is definitely worth the read especially if you love an unreliable narrator which Broder writes so well.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nWhat the heck did I just read Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: I'm really not sure why I finished this book. I guess I needed to know if she made it out of the desert alive.  This book was a fever dream / hallucination.  I never write reviews.  Still not sure why I finished the book.  I did like that it had short chapters.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nWeird and unique reading experience Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: What a weird and wonderful reading journey! I never know what to expect when I read something by Melissa Broder. All of her novels are unique and clever. I thought she tackled the theme of grieving (and how grief can be for things besides just death). And she handles magical realism beautifully which is tough to do.This book won鈥檛 be for everyone as it鈥檚 not your average read but I loved it.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\na wild ride! Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: A fever dream of a book, what a wild ride! Mental health, love, grief, and depression were themes explored in this novel paired with stunning prose and dark humor. A flawed main character that you can鈥檛 help but root for are some of my favorite types of books!\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nit started out with such promise Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: The first part of the book I really thought I would like it, and I wanted to like it but the middle and the last 60% of the book was her hallucinating in the desert talking to cactus and it drug. on. for. what. felt. like. days.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nBizarre, awful book. Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I was just glad when I came to the end of this book, which was as weird and pointless as the rest of it.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
