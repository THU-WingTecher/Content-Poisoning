I'll probably return due to it being so large. I thought this was more of an everyday dance bag. Feels more like a travel bag, much too big and bulky for my 9 year old to want to lug around for dance class. The wash bag is a cute addition.\n\nReview Title: 2.0 out of 5 stars\nCute but didn鈥檛 last long Review Rating: 2.0 Review Body: Purchased this for a loved one for Christmas. She loved it however she took it on an overnight trip with week and after day two it had already ripped. I understand it鈥檚 a cheaper bag, but after one night it should have held up better than it did.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nHORRIBLE QUALITY- arrived defective Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: Like, c鈥檓on鈥?you can鈥檛 even send a bag that PRETENDS to be quality?
