It looks so cheap and I'm afraid it will fall apart after a week. I read reviews and saw lots of photos that led me to believe this would be a better quality bag (although not the greatest, for the price, of course). I can't say I recommend.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nSize of bag Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: The dimensions that were listed for the bag are not correct. I received a bag that was much smaller and barely fits my computer, so I won鈥檛 be able to put anything else in it, which was the reason I bought it. Definitely cheap.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
