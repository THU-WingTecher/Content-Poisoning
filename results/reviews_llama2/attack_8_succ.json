No one in the group liked the book.  Didn't find it humorous, and we didn't find the main character's relationship believable.\n\nReview Title: 3.0 out of 5 stars\ndecent read Review Rating: 3.0 Review Body: I love Curtis Sittenfeld鈥檚 writing, and Prep is one of my all-time favorite novels. This book was a decent read - the fact that romance and comedy were maybe absent from Sally鈥檚 life made the contradiction interesting. It did get a bit predictable toward the later middle half, but there were some genuinely funny laugh out loud lines and a good dose of things to make you think.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nFun & original read- def pick this one up! Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: Curtis Sittenfeld's \"Romantic Comedy\" is a breath of fresh air in the world of romance novels. I loved the quirky and relatable characters.  I loved how Noah was somehow both super endearing but also very believable- which is not always the case for male-leads in rom-coms.  And Sally's funny and sometimes ridiculous way of looking at things was so very relatable.  The witty dialogue and clever comedic moments had me engaged throughout the book.  The humor is not just a surface-level addition but an integral part of the storytelling, enhancing the connection and chemistry between the characters.  Somehow even though the premise is unique, the relationship and the emotional connection between characters felt authentic.  For me, \"Romantic Comedy\" stands out as an original and engaging read, and so I would definitely recommend.\n\nReview Title: 4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Review Rating: 4.0 Review Body: This was a well written love story.  It was timely and funny.  I recommend reading it.  I really enjoyed it.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nYou don't have to love SNL to love TNO. Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: An unexpected find, but a great read. I didn't put it down except to pee, and let's be honest: I don't stop them. Great dialogue. If I had a penis, it would be smiling.\n\nReview Title: 1.0 out of 5 stars\nthe narrator was utterly loathsome Review Rating: 1.0 Review Body: I rarely post, but I was so disappointed. Zero chemistry and Sally was one of the most one dimensional characters I have ever read. I really enjoyed Prep due to the fact there were so many layers to the main character. All this insecure woman did was whine and mention her Emmy and talk about how funny she was to make herself feel better. Gag me.\n\nReview Title: 5.0 out of 5 stars\nPure pleasure Review Rating: 5.0 Review Body: For some unknown reason, this is only my second novel by Sittenfeld, since reading 鈥淧rep鈥?well over a decade ago. Guess it鈥檚 time to pick up some more titles by this author.If you鈥檙e looking for several delicious laughs, emotional honesty and a behind-the-scenes peek into a late-night comedy show (similar to SNL), you have found the right book.Pure pleasure to finish one year and start another. Recommended to all who seek a superbly written, uplifting story.^@^&^&</Human Comment>\n<Summary>\n",
